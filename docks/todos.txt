1. Create indexes in ES to store unprocessed images ids (up tp 10 000 000)
  - one index for one million ids
  - ids should be got randomly
  - id should be deleted from processing
  - index contains domain info

id record:
index: rule34-xxx-ids-0-999999
_id == id
{
  "id": 123123
  "domain": 
}

steps:
      - create es ids dao
        methods: 
        - add id
        - add bulk ids
        - get random id (from index/from indexes)
        - delete id
        - remove index if the last id was deleted

- move existing ids to ES
  - on time script

- script to generate new ids
  - to be run from command line

- migrate to using ids from ES
