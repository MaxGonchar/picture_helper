I have a next data set:

a set of images

each image can contain up to 100 tags 

also I have a user input "is_good" showing if user like an image or not

I want to learn ml model to predict will next image be good for user or not


I assume that some images can have few logs. So few that it can have no sense for model learning and so few to be predicted correctly.

Am I right?

How can I calculate a minimal amount of logs to have a profit from image?
Analyzing Image Tag Data for Model Prediction

Your assumption is correct. Images with very few tags might not provide enough information for the model to learn effectively. This is because the model needs to identify patterns and relationships between tags and user preferences. With limited data, it becomes difficult to establish these patterns.
Determining a Minimum Tag Count

Here's a suggested approach to determine a minimum tag count:

    Data Analysis and Visualization:
        Tag Frequency: Calculate the frequency of each tag in your dataset.
        Tag Co-occurrence: Analyze how often tags appear together.
        Tag Distribution: Visualize the distribution of tags per image.
        Correlation with User Ratings: Examine the correlation between tag frequency or co-occurrence and user ratings.

    Threshold Setting:
        Statistical Analysis: Use statistical methods like hypothesis testing or confidence intervals to determine a threshold for tag frequency or co-occurrence.
        Machine Learning Experimentation: Train models with different minimum tag count thresholds and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
        Domain Knowledge: Consider your specific domain and the importance of certain tags. If certain tags are known to be highly indicative of user preferences, you might set a lower threshold for them.

    Iterative Refinement:
        Model Evaluation: Continuously evaluate your model's performance and adjust the threshold as needed.
        Data Augmentation: If you have a limited dataset, consider techniques like data augmentation to generate additional training examples.

Key considerations:

    Tag Relevance: Not all tags may be equally relevant for predicting user preferences. You might need to prioritize tags based on their correlation with user ratings.
    Model Complexity: The complexity of your machine learning model can also influence the minimum tag count required. More complex models might be able to extract patterns from fewer tags.
    Data Quality: The quality of your data is crucial. Ensure that tags are accurate, consistent, and relevant to the content of the images.

By carefully analyzing your data and experimenting with different thresholds, you can determine a minimum tag count that provides sufficient information for your model to learn and make accurate predictions.
