Understanding the Problem

You have a dataset of images with multiple binary tags. One specific tag, "is_good", is a dependent variable determined by user input. The goal is to identify which tags are irrelevant to predicting "is_good".
Potential Solutions
1. Feature Selection Techniques

    Correlation Analysis:
        Calculate the correlation between each tag and the "is_good" tag.
        Tags with low correlation values might be less important.
    Chi-Square Test:
        Determine if there's a significant association between each tag and "is_good".
        Tags with low chi-square values might be less important.
    Mutual Information:
        Measures the dependency between two variables.
        Tags with low mutual information with "is_good" might be less important.

2. Machine Learning Models

    Model Building:
        Train a classification model (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, SVM) to predict "is_good" based on all tags.
    Feature Importance:
        Analyze the model's feature importance to identify relevant tags.
        Some models (like random forest) provide built-in feature importance scores.

3. Dimensionality Reduction

    Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
        Reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving most of the variance.
        The resulting components can be analyzed to identify important features.

4. Statistical Hypothesis Testing

    Independent t-test:
        Compare the mean values of each tag between "good" and "not good" images.
        Tags with insignificant differences might be less important.

Considerations

    Imbalanced Dataset: If the number of "good" and "not good" images is significantly different, consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling to balance the dataset.
    Tag Interactions: Some tags might be important in combination with others. Feature selection methods might not capture these interactions.
    Domain Knowledge: Incorporate domain expertise to filter out irrelevant tags based on prior knowledge.

Additional Tips

    Visualizations: Create visualizations to explore the data and identify potential patterns.
    Iterative Process: Feature selection is often an iterative process. Combine different methods and refine your approach based on results.
    Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your model with and without the selected features to assess the impact of feature reduction.
